	abstract = {Objective To quantify the background incidence rates of 15 prespecified adverse events of special interest (AESIs) associated with covid-19 vaccines. Design Multinational network cohort study. Setting Electronic health records and health claims data from eight countries: Australia, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States, mapped to a common data model. Participants 126 661 070 people observed for at least 365 days before 1 January 2017, 2018, or 2019 from 13 databases. Main outcome measures Events of interests were 15 prespecified AESIs (non-haemorrhagic and haemorrhagic stroke, acute myocardial infarction, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, anaphylaxis, Bell{\textquoteright}s palsy, myocarditis or pericarditis, narcolepsy, appendicitis, immune thrombocytopenia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, encephalomyelitis (including acute disseminated encephalomyelitis), Guillain-Barr{\'e} syndrome, and transverse myelitis). Incidence rates of AESIs were stratified by age, sex, and database. Rates were pooled across databases using random effects meta-analyses and classified according to the frequency categories of the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences. Results Background rates varied greatly between databases. Deep vein thrombosis ranged from 387 (95\% confidence interval 370 to 404) per 100 000 person years in UK CPRD GOLD data to 1443 (1416 to 1470) per 100 000 person years in US IBM MarketScan Multi-State Medicaid data among women aged 65 to 74 years. Some AESIs increased with age. For example, myocardial infarction rates in men increased from 28 (27 to 29) per 100 000 person years among those aged 18-34 years to 1400 (1374 to 1427) per 100 000 person years in those older than 85 years in US Optum electronic health record data. Other AESIs were more common in young people. For example, rates of anaphylaxis among boys and men were 78 (75 to 80) per 100 000 person years in those aged 6-17 years and 8 (6 to 10) per 100 000 person years in those older than 85 years in Optum electronic health record data. Meta-analytic estimates of AESI rates were classified according to age and sex. Conclusion This study found large variations in the observed rates of AESIs by age group and sex, showing the need for stratification or standardisation before using background rates for safety surveillance. Considerable population level heterogeneity in AESI rates was found between databases. Data sharing: Patient level data cannot be shared without approval from data custodians owing to local information governance and data protection regulations. Aggregated data, analytical code, and detailed definitions of algorithms for identifying the events are available in a GitHub repository (https://github.com/ohdsi-studies/Covid19VaccineAesiIncidenceCharacterization).

  title    = "{PheValuator}: Development and evaluation of a phenotype
              algorithm evaluator",
  author   = "Swerdel, Joel N and Hripcsak, George and Ryan, Patrick B",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The primary approach for defining disease in
              observational healthcare databases is to construct phenotype
              algorithms (PAs), rule-based heuristics predicated on the
              presence, absence, and temporal logic of clinical observations.
              However, a complete evaluation of PAs, i.e., determining
              sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value (PPV), is
              rarely performed. In this study, we propose a tool (PheValuator)
              to efficiently estimate a complete PA evaluation. METHODS: We
              used 4 administrative claims datasets: OptumInsight's
              de-identified ClinformaticsT Datamart (Eden Prairie,MN); IBM
              MarketScan Multi-State Medicaid); IBM MarketScan Medicare
              Supplemental Beneficiaries; and IBM MarketScan Commercial Claims
              and Encounters from 2000 to 2017. Using PheValuator involves (1)
              creating a diagnostic predictive model for the phenotype, (2)
              applying the model to a large set of randomly selected subjects,
              and (3) comparing each subject's predicted probability for the
              phenotype to inclusion/exclusion in PAs. We used the predictions
              as a 'probabilistic gold standard' measure to classify
              positive/negative cases. We examined 4 phenotypes: myocardial
              infarction, cerebral infarction, chronic kidney disease, and
              atrial fibrillation. We examined several PAs for each phenotype
              including 1-time (1X) occurrence of the diagnosis code in the
              subject's record and 1-time occurrence of the diagnosis in an
              inpatient setting with the diagnosis code as the primary reason
              for admission (1X-IP-1stPos). RESULTS: Across phenotypes, the 1X
              PA showed the highest sensitivity/lowest PPV among all PAs.
              1X-IP-1stPos yielded the highest PPV/lowest sensitivity.
              Specificity was very high across algorithms. We found similar
              results between algorithms across datasets. CONCLUSION:
              PheValuator appears to show promise as a tool to estimate PA
              performance characteristics.",

  abstract = "PURPOSE: Phenotype algorithms are central to performing analyses
              using observational data. These algorithms translate the clinical
              idea of a health condition into an executable set of rules
              allowing for queries of data elements from a database.
              PheValuator, a software package in the Observational Health Data
              Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) tool stack, provides a method to
              assess the performance characteristics of these algorithms,
              namely, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative
              predictive value. It uses machine learning to develop predictive
              models for determining a probabilistic gold standard of subjects
              for assessment of cases and non-cases of health conditions.
              PheValuator was developed to complement or even replace the
              traditional approach of algorithm validation, i.e., by expert
              assessment of subject records through chart review. Results in
              our first PheValuator paper suggest a systematic underestimation
              of the PPV compared to previous results using chart review. In
              this paper we evaluate modifications made to the method designed
              to improve its performance. METHODS: The major changes to
              PheValuator included allowing all diagnostic conditions, clinical
              observations, drug prescriptions, and laboratory measurements to
              be included as predictors within the modeling process whereas in
              the prior version there were significant restrictions on the
              included predictors. We also have allowed for the inclusion of
              the temporal relationships of the predictors in the model. To
              evaluate the performance of the new method, we compared the
              results from the new and original methods against results found
              from the literature using traditional validation of algorithms
              for 19 phenotypes. We performed these tests using data from five
              commercial databases. RESULTS: In the assessment aggregating all
              phenotype algorithms, the median difference between the
              PheValuator estimate and the gold standard estimate for PPV was
              reduced from -21 (IQR -34, -3) in Version 1.0 to 4 (IQR -3, 15)
              using Version 2.0. We found a median difference in specificity of
              3 (IQR 1, 4.25) for Version 1.0 and 3 (IQR 1, 4) for Version 2.0.
              The median difference between the two versions of PheValuator and
              the gold standard for estimates of sensitivity was reduced from
              -39 (-51, -20) to -16 (-34, -6). CONCLUSION: PheValuator 2.0
              produces estimates for the performance characteristics for
              phenotype algorithms that are significantly closer to estimates
              from traditional validation through chart review compared to
              version 1.0. With this tool in researcher's toolkits, methods,
              such as quantitative bias analysis, may now be used to improve
              the reliability and reproducibility of research studies using
              observational data.",

We evaluated the extent of information loss that occurred through the standardization process. We developed a standardized analytic tool to replicate the cohort construction process from a published epidemiology protocol and applied the analysis to all 6 databases to assess time-to-execution and comparability of results.Results Transformation to the CDM resulted in minimal information loss across all 6 databases. Patients and observations excluded were due to identified data quality issues in the source system, 96\\% to 99\\% of condition records and 90\\% to 99\\% of drug records were successfully mapped into the CDM using the standard vocabulary. The full cohort replication and descriptive baseline summary was executed for 2 cohorts in 6 databases in less than 1 hour.Discussion The standardization process improved data quality, increased efficiency, and facilitated cross-database comparisons to support a more systematic approach to observational research. Comparisons across data sources showed consistency in the impact of inclusion criteria, using the protocol and identified differences in patient characteristics and coding practices across databases.Conclusion Standardizing data structure (through a CDM), content (through a standard vocabulary with source code mappings), and analytics can enable an institution to apply a network-based approach to observational research across multiple, disparate observational health databases.}",

abstract = {Background
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Biologics Effectiveness and Safety (BEST) Initiative conducts active surveillance of adverse events of special interest (AESI) after COVID-19 vaccination. Historical incidence rates (IRs) of AESI are comparators to evaluate safety.
Methods
We estimated IRs of 17 AESI in six administrative claims databases from January 1, 2019, to December 11, 2020: Medicare claims for adults ≥ 65 years and commercial claims (Blue Health Intelligence®, CVS Health, HealthCore Integrated Research Database, IBM® MarketScan® Commercial Database, Optum pre-adjudicated claims) for adults < 65 years. IRs were estimated by sex, age, race/ethnicity (Medicare), and nursing home residency (Medicare) in 2019 and for specific periods in 2020.
Results
The study included >100 million enrollees annually. In 2019, rates of most AESI increased with age. However, compared with commercially insured adults, Medicare enrollees had lower IRs of anaphylaxis (11 vs 12–19 per 100,000 person-years), appendicitis (80 vs 117–155), and narcolepsy (38 vs 41–53). Rates were higher in males than females for most AESI across databases and varied by race/ethnicity and nursing home status (Medicare). Acute myocardial infarction (Medicare) and anaphylaxis (all databases) IRs varied by season. IRs of most AESI were lower during March–May 2020 compared with March–May 2019 but returned to pre-pandemic levels after May 2020. However, rates of Bell’s palsy, Guillain-Barré syndrome, narcolepsy, and hemorrhagic/non-hemorrhagic stroke remained lower in multiple databases after May 2020, whereas some AESI (e.g., disseminated intravascular coagulation) exhibited higher rates after May 2020 compared with 2019.
Conclusion
AESI background rates varied by database and demographics and fluctuated in March–December 2020, but most returned to pre-pandemic levels after May 2020. It is critical to standardize demographics and consider seasonal and other trends when comparing historical rates with post-vaccination AESI rates in the same database to evaluate COVID-19 vaccine safety.}
